# Refactor code for Horiseon to improve web accessibility

# Horiseon

## Purpose
Web accessible websites give businesses advantages because they are optimized for search engines,
and are therefore better positioned for people to view.
I took existing code for a website that offers marketing services and made it better by making it
meet accessibility standards. I also improved it by using semantic HTML elements, making all links function 
properly, and consolidating CSS properties and selectors.
